# Current-status-of-school-bullying-and-its-influencing-factors
Bullying is a prevalent behavior among young people. The average bullying rate globally is 34%. However, the prevalence rates are significantly different across regions. This indicates that culture may be a factor that has an impact on bullying behavior. A concern is that a particular behavior can be interpreted as different meanings in various cultures. In general, boys and girls are equally victimized in bullying behavior. Male adolescents are more involved in physical bullying. Psychological and sexual bullying do not show the same pattern. In previous studies, girls are more inclined to relational bullying. Small sample size may cause inconsistent results in this study. A regression model of economic factors and bullying rates is built in the currents study. A country's low financial status significantly contributes to the high bullying rates in middle school.
